    "explanation": "A. Both sb1 and sb2 are eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThis option is incorrect because sb2 still holds a reference to the StringBuilder object it was initially assigned. Therefore, it is not eligible for garbage collection.\nB. Only the StringBuilder object initially referenced by sb1 is eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThis option is correct. After sb1 is reassigned to reference the same object as sb2, the original StringBuilder object created with new StringBuilder(\"Java\") and initially referenced by sb1 is no longer accessible. Since there are no references pointing to it, it becomes eligible for garbage collection.\nC. Only the StringBuilder object initially referenced by sb2 is eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThis option is incorrect because after the assignment sb1 = sb2;, both sb1 and sb2 reference the same object (new StringBuilder(\"Python\")). This object is still accessible through sb2 (and now sb1 as well), so it is not eligible for garbage collection.\nD. Neither of the StringBuilder objects are eligible for garbage collection.\n\nThis option is incorrect because, as explained, the object initially referenced by sb1 becomes eligible for garbage collection after sb1 is reassigned to sb2."

    ],
    "explanation": "A. The import statement in Application.java is unnecessary because both classes are in the same directory.\n\nThis option is incorrect. In Java, the import statement is used to bring a class or an entire package into visibility, and its necessity is determined by the package membership of the classes, not their directory location. Even if classes are in the same directory, if they belong to different packages, the import statement is required to use one in the other.\nB. The import statement in Application.java is necessary for using the Calculator class because they belong to different packages.\n\nThis is the correct answer. The Calculator class is in the math package, and the Application class is in the app package. Despite being in the same directory, the different packages require an import statement to use Calculator in Application.\nC. The Calculator class will not be accessible in Application.java due to being in a different directory.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Java's access control is not based on the directory structure but on the package and import declarations. As long as the classes are correctly packaged and imported, they can be accessed across different directories.\nD. Removing the package statement from both files will allow Application.java to use Calculator without an import statement, regardless of directory structure.\n\nThis option is correct. Removing the package statement from both files will place them in the default package, and they will be able to access each other without an import statement. However, this is not recommended for anything beyond very simple or temporary code due to namespace management and readability concerns."

    "explanation": "A. A public class or member can be accessed by any other class in the same package or in any other package.\n\nThis is correct. The public modifier grants the highest level of access. A public class or member is accessible from any other class, regardless of the packages they belong to.\nB. A protected member can be accessed by any class in its own package, but from outside the package, only by classes that extend the class containing the protected member.\n\nThis is correct. The protected access level allows a member to be accessed within its own package and by subclasses in any package. It offers a more restrictive level of access than public.\nC. A member with default (no modifier) access can be accessed by any class in the same package but not from a class in a different package.\n\nThis is correct. If no access modifier (also known as default access level) is specified, the member is accessible only within classes in the same package. This is more restrictive than protected and public.\nD. A private member can be accessed only by methods that are members of the same class or within the same file.\n\nThis option is incorrect because private members can be accessed only within the same class. It's not about being within the same file, as Java allows only one public top-level class per file.\nE. A protected member can be accessed by any class in the Java program, regardless of package.\n\nThis is incorrect. Protected access does not grant universal access across all classes in a program. Access from outside the package is limited to subclasses only."

    "explanation": "A. The class Vehicle demonstrates constructor overloading by having multiple constructors with different parameter lists.\n\nThis option is correct. Constructor overloading in Java is a technique of having more than one constructor with different parameter lists in the same class. It allows objects of the class to be initialized in different ways. The Vehicle class has two constructors, one that takes a String (for the vehicle type) and another that takes an int (for the max speed), which is a perfect example of constructor overloading.\nB. The class Vehicle will compile with an error because it does not provide a default constructor.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Java does not require an explicit default constructor if the class provides any other constructors. The absence of a default constructor (one that takes no arguments) is not a compilation error; it simply means that the programmer cannot instantiate the class using a no-argument constructor unless it's explicitly defined.\nC. It is possible to create an instance of Vehicle with both type and maxSpeed initialized.\n\nThis option is incorrect because with the current constructors, it's not possible to create a Vehicle instance with both type and maxSpeed initialized through a single constructor call.\nD. Calling either constructor will initialize both type and maxSpeed fields of the Vehicle class.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Calling either constructor only initializes the parameter that is provided to it. The first constructor initializes the type, and the second initializes the maxSpeed. Without additional code, such as a constructor that accepts both parameters or setter methods, there's no way for either constructor alone to initialize both fields."

Calling equals(Object obj) on two different instances of CustomObject that have identical content will return true because they are instances of the same class.\n\nThis option is incorrect.

Local classes are a type of static nested class and can access both static and non-static members of the enclosing class directly.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Local classes are not static; they are associated with an instance of the enclosing class and have access to its instance members. They do not have the static context that static nested classes have, and thus they can access both static and non-static members of the enclosing class.\nD. Local classes can access local variables and parameters of the enclosing block only if they are declared final or effectively final.\n\nThis is correct. Local classes can access local variables and parameters of the method (or any enclosing block) in which they are defined, but those variables must be declared final or effectively final (which means their values do not change after they are initialized)."

An anonymous class must override all methods in the superclass or interface it declares it is implementing or extending.\n\nThis option is incorrect.

If a class is declared public, it must be the only public class in the file, and the file name must match the class name.\nB. Private classes can be declared at the top level in a source file.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Java does not allow classes to be declared as private at the top level. Only public, or package-private (no access modifier) classes can be defined at the top level. Inner classes can be private.\nC. A public class must be declared in a source file that has the same name as the class.\n\nThis is correct. According to Java's rules, if a class is declared public, the source file in which it is defined must have the same name as the class, followed by the .java extension. This is a strict rule that helps the Java compiler easily locate source files.\nD. If a source file contains more than one class, none of the classes can be public.\n\nThis is incorrect. While it is true that if a source file contains a public class, the source file must be named after that public class, it is not true that none of the classes can be public if a source file contains more than one class. A source file can contain multiple classes, but only one of them can be public, and the source file must be named after that public class. The statement could imply that multiple non-public top-level classes are a common scenario without the context of the public class naming rule."

The code compiles and outputs 3 followed by 1 and an undefined value for y.\n\nThis option is incorrect because Java does not allow access to local variables (y in this case) outside of their scope. The notion of an \"undefined value for y\" is not applicable here; the compiler will simply not compile the code.\nC. The code does not compile because y is accessed outside of its scope.\n\nThis is the correct option. Local variable y is declared inside the if block, and thus, it is only accessible within that block.

    "explanation": "A. var can be used to declare both local variables within methods and instance variables within classes.\n\nThis option is incorrect because var cannot be used to declare instance variables. It is specifically restricted to local variables within methods, constructors, or initializer blocks, as using var for fields would reduce the clarity of a class's public API.\nB. The use of var is restricted to local variables within methods, constructors, or initializer blocks.\n\nThis option is correct. var is intended for local variable type inference, significantly reducing the verbosity of Java code in scenarios where the compiler can easily determine the type of the local variable from its initializer. Its use is restricted to ensure clarity and prevent ambiguity in more complex constructs like class fields or method parameters.\nC. var can be used to declare method parameters.\n\nThis option is incorrect. The example clearly demonstrates that var cannot be used to declare method parameters. This limitation ensures that method signatures remain explicit in their type requirements, a critical aspect of a class's contract with its callers.\nD. var enhances readability by inferring types where it's clear from the context, but it's not allowed in method signatures to maintain clarity.\n\nThis option is correct. While var is primarily used to improve code readability by reducing the need for explicit type declarations where the type can be inferred from the context, it is not allowed in method signatures. This restriction ensures that the types of parameters in methods are always explicitly defined, aiding in the readability and maintainability of public APIs.\nE. var can be used to declare class (static) variables.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Similar to instance variables, var is not permissible for declaring class (static) variables. The rationale behind this restriction aligns with the goal of maintaining explicit type declarations in the class's structure, ensuring the class's design remains clear and unambiguous to both the compiler and developers."

This usage demonstrates this as a way to refer explicitly to properties or methods of the current object."

In the Dog constructor, super(name); is used to call the superclass (Animal) constructor with the name parameter. This is necessary to initialize the name field inherited from the Animal class in the Dog instance.\nB. The eat method in the Dog class uses super to invoke the superclass's eat method.\n\nThis optional is correct. The eat method in the Dog class calls super.eat(); to invoke the eat method defined in the superclass (Animal). This allows the Dog class to extend the functionality of the eat method beyond what is defined in the superclass, demonstrating method overriding and use of super to access the overridden method.\nC. Removing the super.eat(); call in the Dog class's eat method will prevent the Dog class from compiling.\n\nThis optional is incorrect. Removing the super.eat(); call from the Dog class's eat method would not prevent the class from compiling. It would simply mean that the Dog class's eat method no longer calls the superclass's eat method, altering the program's behavior but not its compilability.\nD. The super keyword can be used to access static methods from the superclass.\n\nThis optional is incorrect. While super can indeed be used to access superclass methods, it's not specifically used or necessary for accessing static methods. Static methods belong to the class, not to instances, and should be invoked using the class name. super is used primarily for instance methods and constructors."

Due to the difference in parameter types, the Car class's drive method does not override but rather overloads the Vehicle class's drive method. Since the method is called on a Vehicle reference, the Vehicle class's drive method is invoked.\nB.

It does not compile because the drive method in the Car class does not properly override the drive method in the Vehicle class.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the code does compile. The @Override annotation does not cause a compile-time error here because it is not strictly enforced in terms of method overloading (changing the parameter type creates a new method signature, making this a valid overload).\nD. It compiles and prints \"Vehicle driving at speed: 60\" because the drive method in the Car class is an overload, not an override.\n\nThis option is correct. The drive method in the Car class has a different signature from the drive method in the Vehicle class due to the parameter type (int vs. long). Therefore, the drive method in the Car class overloads the superclass method rather than overriding it. When a Vehicle reference calls the drive method with an int argument, it invokes the Vehicle class's drive method, not the Car class's method."

This is because the color method is not part of the Fruit class's interface.\nB. It compiles and prints \"Fruit flavor\".\n\nThis option is incorrect for a similar reason to A. The flavor method would print \"Apple flavor\" because of the overridden method in the Apple class, not \"Fruit flavor\". However, the presence of the color() method call would still prevent compilation.\nC. It compiles but throws a runtime exception when attempting to call color().\n\nThis option is incorrect because the issue occurs at compile time, not runtime. The Java compiler will not allow a method to be called on a reference type if that method is not defined in the reference type's class or its superclass hierarchy.\nD. It does not compile because Apple is not a valid type of Fruit.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Apple is a valid type of Fruit due to inheritance (Apple extends Fruit). This relationship allows an Apple object to be referenced by a Fruit variable.\nE. It does not compile because the color method is not defined in the Fruit class.\n\nThis option is correct. The color method is only defined in the Apple class and not in the Fruit class. Since the reference type of myFruit is Fruit, which does not have a color method, attempting to call myFruit.color() will result in a compilation error. This illustrates a key principle of polymorphism: the type of the reference (not the object) determines what methods can be called."

    "explanation": "A. It compiles and prints \"String with Java: Hello Java!\" followed by \"Integer greater than 10: 15\".\n\nThis option is correct. The code snippet effectively demonstrates the use of pattern matching with the instanceof operator for both String and Integer types. The pattern matching feature checks if input is an instance of String or Integer and binds it to a variable (s for String and i for Integer) within the scope of the if and else if blocks. The logical operator && is correctly used to further conditionally check properties of the variables (s.contains(\"Java\") and i > 10). Thus, the method process prints output for inputs that are a String containing \"Java\" and an Integer greater than 10, respectively.\nB. It compiles but only prints \"String with Java: Hello Java!\" because integers are not supported with pattern matching.\n\nThis option is incorrect because pattern matching works for any reference type, including Integer. The code does support integers and performs additional checks using pattern matching correctly.\nC. It does not compile because pattern matching in instanceof cannot be combined with logical operators like &&.\n\nThis option is incorrect. The code will compile and run as expected. Pattern matching in instanceof can indeed be combined with logical operators like && for additional checks in the same conditional statement, as demonstrated in the code snippet.\nD. It compiles but prints all four lines due to incorrect use of pattern matching that always evaluates to true.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the use of pattern matching in the provided code is correct and does not always evaluate to true.

The class is not encapsulated because the Product class's fields are private.\n\nThis option is incorrect. The use of private fields is a fundamental aspect of encapsulation. It prevents external classes from directly accessing and modifying the object's state, thus enforcing encapsulation.\nC.

Thus, it doesn't highlight the fact that all fields in Contact are final and the defensive copying strategy.\nC. The Contact object is immutable, and it properly prevents leakage of mutable internal state through defensive copying.\n\nThis is the correct option. The Contact class is immutable because it meets all criteria for immutability: the class is declared as final (preventing subclassing), all its fields are private and final, and it does not provide any setters. Also, it implements defensive copying for the mutable Address field to ensure that the internal state cannot be altered by external changes to Address objects passed in or returned. This prevents the leakage of its mutable internal state.\nD.

The Contact object is immutable but fails to prevent access to its mutable internal state.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the Contact object does implement a strategy to prevent access to its mutable internal state: it uses defensive copying for the Address object in both the constructor and the getter method, which ensures that the internal state remains unchanged from outside modifications."

The Employee record explicitly defines a public constructor that initializes its fields.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the record Employee does not explicitly define a public constructor. Records automatically generate a public constructor with the same parameters as the record's declaration.\nB. The fields name and age can be reassigned to new values after an Employee object is created.\n\nThis option is incorrect as the fields within a record are final, which means they cannot be reassigned to new values after an Employee object has been created. This immutability is one of the key characteristics of records.\nC. The Employee record implicitly creates a public constructor and private final fields for name and age.\n\nThis is the correct option. Records implicitly create a public constructor for the record's fields and also make these fields private and final. This means you don't have to manually write boilerplate code for constructor, getters, or to ensure immutability.\nD. It is mandatory to define getters for the fields name and age in the Employee record.\n\nThis option is incorrect because records automatically generate public methods to access the fields, known as accessor methods, which essentially act as getters. Therefore, it is not mandatory (or even possible) to define separate getters for the fields."

The fields of a record are final and cannot be modified after the object's construction, which is a key aspect of their design to enforce immutability.\nB. Once an Account object is created, its id and balance cannot be changed.\n\nThis is the correct option. Records are immutable by design, meaning that once a record object is created, the values of its fields (id and balance in this case) cannot be changed. This immutability is ensured by making the fields private and final, and by not providing setter methods.\nC. Immutability of records can be bypassed by you define custom setter methods for the id and balance fields.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Custom setter methods cannot be defined for the record fields because records do not allow defining mutators for their components.\nD. Records allow field values to be modified if accessed directly, without using setter methods.\n\nThis option is incorrect because the fields in a record are implicitly final and private, which means they cannot be modified directly or through setter methods.

The correct syntax for instantiating a record involves using the new keyword followed by the record name and the parameters in parentheses.\nC. Product p = {101, \"Coffee\", 15.99};\n\nThis option is incorrect as it mistakenly uses the syntax for array initialization. In Java, objects, including records, cannot be instantiated using curly braces without the new keyword and proper constructor.\nD. Product p = new Product(101, \"Coffee\", 15.99);\n\nThis is the correct option.

Records in Java can implement interfaces. The finality and immutability of records do not preclude them from implementing interfaces, which can be used to add behaviors or contractual obligations to a record.\nB. This record correctly implements the Comparable interface, allowing Item objects to be sorted based on their price.\n\nThis is the correct option. The provided record definition correctly implements the Comparable<Item> interface by overriding the compareTo method. This customization allows instances of the Item record to be sorted based on the price field, demonstrating that records can indeed implement interfaces and override their methods as needed.\nC. Implementing interfaces in records is restricted only to functional interfaces due to their immutable nature.\n\nThis option is incorrect. There is no such restriction that limits records to implementing only functional interfaces. Records can implement any interface, including those with multiple abstract methods, as long as the record provides implementations for the abstract methods defined in the interface.\nD. The compareTo method cannot be overridden in records because method overriding is not supported in record types.\n\nThis option is incorrect.

The public access modifier makes this enum accessible from any other class.\n\nB.\n\nenum Month {\n    private JANUARY, FEBRUARY, MARCH, APRIL, MAY, JUNE, JULY, AUGUST, SEPTEMBER, OCTOBER, NOVEMBER, DECEMBER;\n}\nThis option is incorrect. Enums cannot have private access modifiers for their constants.

First, protected is not a valid access modifier for enums at the top level. Enums can be public or package-private (no modifier). Second, the printDirection() method is missing a visibility modifier, and it appears to be intended as a private method (which would also be incorrect as it wouldn't be callable from outside the enum itself), but the syntax is incorrect as it lacks the void return type.\n\nD.\n\npublic enum Season {\n    WINTER, SPRING, SUMMER, FALL;\n    public void printSeason() {\n        System.out.println(\"The season is \" + this.name());\n    }\n}\nThis is the correct option. The printSeason() method is properly defined: it's public, non-static, and utilizes the this reference to access the name of the current enum constant. This method correctly provides custom behavior for each enum constant, allowing it to print a message indicating the current season."

Therefore, the program prints \"x is between 5 and 20\".\nB. x is 5 or less\n\nThis option is incorrect. The value of x is 10, which does not satisfy the condition x <= 5 in the else block. Therefore, this message will not be printed.\nC. x is greater than 20\n\nThis option is incorrect. The value of x is 10, which does not satisfy the condition x > 20. Therefore, this message will not be printed.\nD. The program does not compile\n\nThis option is incorrect. The program compiles successfully without any errors.\nE. The program compiles but does not produce any output\n\nThis option is incorrect. The program produces output because the value of x satisfies the conditions within the nested if statements, leading to the output \"x is between 5 and 20\"."

A checked exception does not inherit from java.lang.RuntimeException. Checked exceptions are subclasses of java.lang.Exception but not of java.lang.RuntimeException.\nB. A checked exception must be either caught or declared in the method signature using the throws keyword.\n\nThis option is correct. Checked exceptions must be either caught using a try-catch block or declared in the method signature with the throws keyword. This is to ensure that the exception is properly handled at some point in the code.\nC. A checked exception is an error that is typically caused by the environment in which the application is running, and it cannot be handled by the application.\n\nThis option is incorrect.

The resulting LocalDateTime will be 2014-01-02 14:30:59:999999.\nD. An exception is thrown\n\nThis option is incorrect. The provided parameters of 14 for hour, 30 for minute, 59 for second, and 999999 for nanosecond are all valid values for their respective fields, so combining them with the LocalDate will not throw an exception."

LocalTime has nanosecond precision, so you can perform operations on LocalTime using the NANOS unit.\nC. DAY\n\nThis option is incorrect. DAY is not a valid ChronoUnit for LocalTime. Similar to YEAR, LocalTime has no concept of days since it only represents a time, not a date.\nD. HALF_DAYS\n\nThis option is correct. HALF_DAYS is a valid ChronoUnit for LocalTime. A day can be divided into two 12-hour periods (AM and PM), so HALF_DAYS can be used with LocalTime to represent a difference or addition of 12 hour chunks of time."

Since the first date (2025-03-20) is later than the second date (2025-02-20), the resulting period will be negative, not positive.\nB. P-29D\n\nThis option is incorrect. While the resulting period will be negative, it will not be represented as -29D. A Period first counts the number of complete months, then the remaining days.\nC. P1M\n\nThis option is incorrect. The resulting period will be negative because the first date is later than the second date.\nD. P-1M\n\nThis option is correct. The Period.between method subtracts the second date from the first date. In this case, 2025-03-20 minus 2025-02-20 results in a period of -1 month, which is represented as P-1M.

However, since LocalTime.of(18, 5) is being compared to a LocalDateTime, this causes an issue because they are not of the same type.\nB. PT-5M\n\nThis option is incorrect. PT-5M represents a duration of negative 5 minutes. Similar to option A, this would only be the case if the second time point was before the first. The main issue is that there is a type mismatch between LocalDateTime and LocalTime.\nC. PT300S\n\nThis option is incorrect. PT300S represents a duration of 300 seconds (or 5 minutes), which again would be the result if the second time point was 5 minutes after the first. However, this still doesn't resolve the type mismatch issue between LocalDateTime and LocalTime.\nD. An exception is thrown\n\nThis option is correct. An exception is thrown because there is a type mismatch between LocalDateTime.of(2025, 3, 20, 18, 0) and LocalTime.of(18, 5). The Duration.between method requires two temporal objects of the same type."

Adding 1 hour to the initial time 2025-10-04T00:00-03:00[America/Asuncion] while considering the start of DST (which typically adds 1 hour to the local time) means that the effective time would be adjusted by the DST transition.\nC. 2025-10-04T02:00-03:00[America/Asuncion]\n\nThis option is correct.

Since the input string \"11:50:20 Z\" does not contain a date part, this will cause a DateTimeParseException.\nC. Z is an invalid offset.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Z is a valid offset representing UTC (Coordinated Universal Time).\nD. An exception is thrown at runtime.\n\nThis option is correct. An exception is thrown at runtime because the input string \"11:50:20 Z\" does not match the expected pattern for an OffsetDateTime, which typically includes a date part as well as the time and offset."

An automatic module is created from a JAR file that is placed on the module path but does not have a module descriptor (module-info.java). The module system infers a module name from the JAR file name and exports all packages in the JAR.\nB. Default module\n\nThis option incorrect. There is no concept of a \"default module\" in JPMS. The term might be confused with unnamed modules or other types of configurations, but it is not a recognized type.\nC. Unnamed module\n\nThis option is correct. The unnamed module is a special module that includes all classes on the classpath. It does not have a module descriptor and can access other unnamed modules but cannot be required by named modules.\nD. Core module\n\nThis option is incorrect. There is no specific type called \"core module\" in JPMS. JPMS does not categorize modules this way.\nE. Primary module\n\nThis option is incorrect.

    "explanation": "A. An unnamed module can depend on named modules and other unnamed modules.\n\nThis option is incorrect. An unnamed module can depend on named modules, which is true. However, unnamed modules cannot depend on other unnamed modules. Unnamed modules are created when classes are loaded from the classpath, and they cannot read other unnamed modules. They can only read the named modules of the platform and other modules explicitly added to the module path.\nB. Automatic modules must have a module-info.java file to be placed on the module path.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Automatic modules do not require a module-info.java file. Their module name is inferred from the JAR file name.\nC. Unnamed modules can export their packages to named modules using module-info.java.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Unnamed modules cannot export packages because they do not use module-info.java.\nD. An automatic module is created when a JAR file without a module-info.java is placed on the module path, and it can read all other modules.\n\nThis option is correct.

The Locale.setDefault(Locale.Category, Locale) method can set the default locale for both the DISPLAY and FORMAT categories, not just FORMAT.\nC. Using Locale.getDefault(Locale.Category) always returns the same locale regardless of the category specified.\n\nThis option is incorrect.

    "explanation": "A. Resource bundles can only be stored in .properties files.\n\nThis option is incorrect. While .properties files are commonly used for resource bundles, Java also supports class-based resource bundles. These are Java classes that extend ResourceBundle and provide localized resources programmatically.\nB. The ResourceBundle.getBundle() method always throws a MissingResourceException if the requested bundle is not found.\n\nThis option is incorrect. The ResourceBundle.getBundle() method does not always throw a MissingResourceException if the requested bundle is not found. It follows a fallback mechanism, trying to find the most specific bundle, then falling back to more general bundles, and finally to the default bundle.\nC. When searching for a resource bundle, Java only considers the specified locale and its language.\n\nThis option is incorrect. When searching for a resource bundle, Java considers not only the specified locale and its language but also the country, variant, and even the default locale. It follows a well-defined lookup procedure to find the most appropriate bundle.\nD. If a key is not found in a specific locale's resource bundle, Java will look for it in the parent locale's bundle.\n\nThis option is correct. Java implements a parent chain fallback mechanism for resource bundles. If a key is not found in the specific locale's bundle, it will look in the parent locale's bundle. For example, if a key is not found in a fr_FR (French France) bundle, it will look in the fr (French) bundle, and then in the default bundle.\nE. Resource bundles are loaded dynamically at runtime, so changes to .properties files are immediately reflected in the running application.\n\nThis option is incorrect. Resource bundles are typically loaded when ResourceBundle.getBundle() is called and then cached. Changes to .properties files are not immediately reflected in a running application. The application usually needs to be restarted or the resource bundle cache cleared for changes to take effect."

This formatter applies the appropriate currency symbol, digit grouping, and decimal separator according to the locale's conventions.\nB.
